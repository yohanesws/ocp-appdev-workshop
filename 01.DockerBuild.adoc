= Docker Build With OpenShift

== Dockerfile

"With Docker, developers can build any app in any language using any toolchain. “Dockerized” apps are completely portable and can run anywhere - colleagues’ OS X and Windows laptops, QA servers running Ubuntu in the cloud, and production data center VMs running Red Hat.

Developers can get going quickly by starting with one of the 13,000+ apps available on Docker Hub. Docker manages and tracks changes and dependencies, making it easier for sysadmins to understand how the apps that developers builvd work. And with Docker Hub, developers can automate their build pipeline and share artifacts with collaborators through public or private repositories.

Docker helps developers build and ship higher-quality applications, faster." -- https://www.docker.com/what-docker#copy1[What is Docker]

=== Common Syntax

* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file[.dockerignore]
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from[FROM] Sets the Base Image for subsequent instructions.
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run[RUN] execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results.
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd[CMD] provide defaults for an executing container.
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#expose [EXPOSE]informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime.  NOTE: does not actually make ports accessible.
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#env[ENV] sets environment variable.
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#add[ADD] copies new files, directories or remote file to container.  Invalidates caches. Avoid `ADD` and use `COPY` instead.
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy[COPY] copies new files or directories to container.  Note that this only copies as root, so you have to chown manually regardless of your USER / WORKDIR setting.  See https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/30110
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint[ENTRYPOINT] configures a container that will run as an executable.
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#volume[VOLUME] creates a mount point for externally mounted volumes or other containers.
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#user[USER] sets the user name for following RUN / CMD / ENTRYPOINT commands.
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir[WORKDIR] sets the working directory.
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg[ARG] defines a build-time variable.
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#onbuild[ONBUILD] adds a trigger instruction when the image is used as the base for another build.
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#stopsignal[STOPSIGNAL] sets the system call signal that will be sent to the container to exit.
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/labels-custom-metadata/[LABEL] apply key/value metadata to your images, containers, or daemons.

## Registry & Repository

A repository is a hosted collection of tagged images that together create the file system for a container.

A registry is a *host* -- a server that stores repositories and provides an HTTP API for https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockerrepos/[managing the uploading and downloading of repositories].

* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login[`docker login`] to login to a registry.
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logout[`docker logout`] to logout from a registry.
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/search[`docker search`] searches registry for image.
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull[`docker pull`] pulls an image from registry to local machine.
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push[`docker push`] pushes an image to the registry from local machine.

== Build Container

== Prepare .NET CORE builder

go to command line and login as cluster admin and run command below:
 
----
$ oc login -u system:admin
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/s2i-dotnetcore/master/dotnet_imagestreams.json -n openshift
----

=== Sample Dockerfile and Creating the project

Create empty aspnet project

----
$ mkdir <your_project_dir>
$ dotnet new web
$ dotnet restore -r rhel.7-x64
$ dotnet publish -f netcoreapp2.1 -c Release -r rhel.7-x64 --self-contained true
----

We will using below Dockerfile on this lab:

-----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/dotnet/dotnet-21-runtime-rhel7:latest

ADD bin/release/netcoreapp2.1/rhel.7-x64/publish/. .

CMD [ "dotnet", "mydotnetapps.dll" ]
-----

Please save above code in file called *Dockerfile* at <your_project_dir>

=== Build Dockerfile using OCP

In openshift we can build above *Dockerfile* and automatically save it into openshift internal repository. The step are :

==== 01.OpenShift CLI
Before we continue please donwload https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v3.9.0[OpenShift CLI] and pick based on OS you have right now

==== 02. Login to OpenShift
After OpenShift CLI is download we can used it to login to openshift:
----
$oc login <OPENSHIFT-URL>
----

Please fill your openshift console url in command above

==== 03. Create new Project

Projects are a top level concept to help you organize your deployments. An OpenShift project allows a community of users (or a user) to organize and manage their content in isolation from other communities. Each project has its own resources, policies (who can or cannot perform actions), and constraints (quotas and limits on resources, etc). Projects act as a "wrapper" around all the application services and endpoints you (or your teams) are using for your work.

To create project is using command below:
----
$oc new-project <name-of-project>
----

==== 04. Create new Build

Build is component in openshift for creating an image for container. Thus, we need create it hence openshift can create image based on container above:
----
$oc new-build --name=testcontainer --binary
* A Docker build using binary input will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream "testcontainer:latest"
      * A binary build was created, use 'start-build --from-dir' to trigger a new build

--> Creating resources with label build=testcontainer ...
    imagestream "testcontainer" created
    buildconfig "testcontainer" created
--> Success

----

==== 05. Start new Build

After we create the build then we can start it using command below:
----
$cd <your_project_dir>
$oc start-build testcontainer --from-dir=. --follow
build "testcontainer-1" started
Receiving source from STDIN as archive ...
....
Successfully built ad890073c1a7
Pushing image 172.30.245.248:5000/yohanes-demo/testcontainer:latest ...
Pushed 0/2 layers, 50% complete
Pushed 1/2 layers, 51% complete
Pushed 2/2 layers, 100% complete
Push successful
----

==== 06.Check Image Created

After build is completed image will be created and can be check through OpenShift Console like shown below:

image:images.png[]
